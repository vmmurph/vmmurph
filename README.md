ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Vincent.

I created this account to play around with and host little projects while learning D3.js. Please take a look at the links below:

[Generalized Sierpinski](https://vmmurph.github.io/sierpinski-general/main.html) is something that generates a [Sierpinski's Triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle) through a simple algorithm. Clicking the "Create x" buttons will make x points according to the algorithm, and you can see the triangle take shape (warning: this can be CPU intensive, especially "Create 100,000"). I was curious if this could be done with regular polygons with more sides - that's what the dropdown in the top left is for. 4 sides is quite boring, but 5 sides and some others are interesting!

[Space scales](https://vmmurph.github.io/space-scales/main.html?data=moons) is a visualization of bodies in our solar system relative to one another. In the top left, you can click on the button initially marked "Radius" to cycle between other metrics (mass and density). Click on one of the celestial objects, and it's sent into the black hole in the top left! If you click on the black hole, you can see everything on the other side and move objects back by clicking on them.

[US GDP Graph](https://vmmurph.github.io/gdp-bar-graph/main.html) is a chart showing the US's GDP from 1946 to 2015. The color of the bar for each year is color coded green for growth, red for decline, and white for neutral. There are gradients between those depending on the intensity of the growth/decline - I thought it was a cool way to sneak more info into an otherwise normal graph. You can pan your mouse over the bars to see more specific numbers.

[Game of Life](https://vmmurph.github.io/game-of-life/main.html) is more of a toy than a game, but I've known it as [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). You start with some points on a grid, and through each timestep they are put through a simple set of rules that can create intricate patterns that are more complex than the sum of its parts. To use it, click on the grid to add points. Then you can hit "Step" to step through one interation of the rules. Hit "Start" to have it quickly and automatically step. If you hit one of the "Scenario" buttons, these are configurations that I thought had an amusing lifecycle to watch.

[Hex Life](https://vmmurph.github.io/hex-life/main.html) is something I created to simulate plant and animal life, as well as evolution (in a very limited sense). Plants (ie dots that grow into the hexes) quickly spread throughout the grid, with small color variations each time they propagate. Animals (donut shape) eat the plants that are the same color as they are, but have trouble the farther away the color is - green animals eat green plants, and have trouble eating blue, and can't eat red at all. The animals will also shift color when they reproduce, and can also die. In this way, the plants will influence which of the animals survive, and vice-versa. It's a bit like watching an ant-hill.
